# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure Post-Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply correctly after the build process. The issue is intermittent and appears to be connected to either the order of CSS imports or a caching problem within the build pipeline.

## Bug Description

The Tailwind CSS classes are defined correctly within the component's code, but after building the project, some or all classes might not be rendered, leading to unexpected styling issues. The problem is not consistent and does not always occur on every build.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm install.
3. Build the project using the project's build script (e.g. npm run build).
4. Observe the rendered output; inconsistencies in class application might occur randomly.

## Potential Causes

* **Order of CSS imports:** The incorrect order of CSS imports can interfere with the application of Tailwind CSS classes.
* **Caching issues:** Caching mechanisms within the build process can occasionally cause outdated CSS files to be used.
* **Conflicting plugins:** Conflicting plugins or custom configurations can interfere with the Tailwind CSS functionality.

## Solution

Please refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a possible solution to resolve this issue.  The solution might involve re-organizing CSS imports, clearing the cache, or adjusting your Tailwind configuration file.
